# MatrixProject

In this repository I have a basic implementation of the Tetris game.
Tetris was one of my favourite games growing up, as befofe the sametphone era
the most accesible way for kids to play video games was on those "brick"
consoles which contained a lot of games, also having my favourite, Tetris.

My implementation in Arduino has all the clasic blocks and follows the game's rules.
When a horizontal line is filled it gets destroyed, the following lines move down
one step and the player gains a point. When a block fails to spawn the game ends.
The game also allows rotation for all blocks except O and I.
 
The player's objective is quite intuitive, try to complete as many horizontal lines
while tring to not overfill the screen (and paying close attention to the center).

The game components are:
Three breadboard (170, 400 and 830 respectively)
A potentiometer
Several wires
An LCD
An Arduino Uno
An 8x8 Matrix display
A MAX7219 driver
